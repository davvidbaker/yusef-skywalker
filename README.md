Project for a friend back in college. 

**One of the first things web things I ever made.**

A different friend and I put a QR code in a booklet for Yusef's dance show, that led to this site. *At the time*, I figured since it was only going to be seen on mobile (because the need for a QR code scanner), there was no need to make it look good anywhere else.
